                    <h2>Spending Time with NL</h2>
                    <p>Spending time with Natalie's art took me on a journey of reflection, meditation, and unfiltered existence. 
                        She navigates joy and sorrow as well as the complexity between them. 
                        In her work, I find that I seen, my reality is captured, and I desire to live into the fullness of what it means to be human.
