                In your words
                <br>
                I find that there is space for me
                <br>
                To be
                <br>
                To breathe
                <br>
                To feel a multiplicity of feelings
                <br>
                And consider it beautiful
                <br>
                That in my feeling, deeply
                <br>
                I find connection 
                <br>
                With my humanity
                <br>
                Inviting me to live
                <br>
                In the light of liberation
                <br>
                And the hope 
                <br>
                Of the process.

                In the space of your canvas
                <br>
                I am asked to remember
                <br>
                What maybe I never knew
                <br>
                Or maybe what surviving 
                <br>
                Has tried to take from me
                <br>
                The memory
                <br>
                Our collective story
                <br>
                Shared within this skin
                <br>
                My tears friends
                <br>
                Speaking truth to me
                <br>
                When I would rather 
                <br>
                Allow my smile to lie
                <br>
                Somehow I see myself reflected
                <br>
                In what you create.

                Here still,
                <br>
                I find that it can all fit together
                <br>
                Oh to be Black and queer in love
                <br>
                And call it good
                <br>
                And believe that which flows from it
                <br>
                is goodness
                <br>
                To say that God is up to something good
                <br>
                And that good thing 
                <br>
                Being me
                <br>
                Coming how to myself
                <br>
                Learning and relearning to love this skin
                <br>
                And to value my breath,
                <br>
                My body,
                <br>
                My art,
                <br>
                As sacred.
